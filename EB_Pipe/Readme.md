# EB_Pipe Project

This project contains AWS CDK scripts for setting up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy applications into AWS Elastic Beanstalk and ECR (Elastic Container Registry). The project is organized into multiple stacks, each responsible for different aspects of the infrastructure.

### Contents

- **app_cdk_stack.py**: Defines the foundational infrastructure components.
- **eb_stack.py**: Manages the Elastic Beanstalk specific resources and environment setup.
- **ecr_cdk_stack.py**: Manages the ECR specific resources, including creating repositories for different services.
- **pipeline_cdk_stack.py**: Sets up the CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline, CodeCommit, and CodeBuild to automate the deployment process.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS CDK
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Docker (for building Docker images)

### Initial Setup

1. **Install CDK CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk

    Create a Virtual Environment:

    bash

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install Dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Bootstrapping the CDK Environment

Before deploying any CDK stacks, make sure to bootstrap your AWS environment:

bash

cdk bootstrap

Deploying the Stacks

    Synthesize the CloudFormation Templates:

    bash

cdk synth

Deploy the Stacks:

bash

    cdk deploy --all

Detailed Component Descriptions
AppCdkStack

Defines foundational infrastructure components.
EBApplnStack (eb_stack.py)

Sets up Elastic Beanstalk resources, including:

    Creating an Elastic Beanstalk application and environment.
    Uploading application source code as an S3 asset.
    Configuring instance profiles and IAM roles.

EcrCdkStack

Creates ECR repositories for various services:

    Defines multiple repositories for different microservices (e.g., api, client, db, worker, redis).
    Each repository is set up to store Docker images for respective services.

PipelineCdkStack

Configures the CI/CD pipeline:

    CodeCommit: Repository for source code.
    CodeBuild: Projects for code quality checks and Docker image builds.
    CodePipeline: Orchestrates the flow from source code check-in to deployment.

Testing

Run tests using:

bash

cdk test

Useful Commands

    cdk ls: List all stacks in the app.
    cdk synth: Synthesize CloudFormation templates.
    cdk deploy: Deploy the stack to your default AWS account/region.
    cdk diff: Compare deployed stack with the current state.
    cdk test: Run unit tests.
