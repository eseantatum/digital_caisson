## Subfolder Descriptions

### cicd_workshop

This folder contains a tutorial on setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Amazon ECR. The focus is on deploying Dockerized applications.

- **buildspec_docker.yml**: The build specification for CodeBuild, detailing steps for installing dependencies, logging into ECR, building Docker images, and pushing them to ECR.
- **app-cdk/**: Contains the CDK application code for setting up the necessary AWS infrastructure.
  - **app.py**: The entry point for the CDK application, defining stacks for ECR, application deployment, and pipeline.
  - **app_cdk/**:
    - **ecr_cdk_stack.py**: Defines the ECR stack, setting up repositories for different services.
    - **pipeline_cdk_stack.py**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline stack, configuring the CodePipeline and CodeBuild projects.

**Purpose**: Demonstrate how to use AWS CDK to create a CI/CD pipeline for Docker applications and push images to Amazon ECR.

**Limitations**: Assumes familiarity with Docker, AWS CLI, and basic CDK concepts. Requires AWS CLI and Docker to be installed and configured.

### eb_cdk_pipe_tutorial/cdk-pipeline-eb-demo

This folder contains a tutorial on setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and deploying a web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- **bin/**:
  - **cdk-pipeline-eb-demo.ts**: Entry point for the CDK application, initializing the app and defining the `CdkPipelineStack`.
- **lib/**:
  - **cdk-pipeline-eb-demo-stack.ts**: Placeholder stack for additional resources required by the application.
  - **cdk-pipeline-stack.ts**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline. Includes stages for source code retrieval and build steps.
  - **eb-appln-stack.ts**: Defines the Elastic Beanstalk application and environment stack. Configures application versioning, instance roles, and environment settings.
  - **eb-stage.ts**: Defines the deployment stage for the Elastic Beanstalk application.
- **src/**: Directory for the application code to be deployed.

**Purpose**: Demonstrate how to use AWS CDK to create a CI/CD pipeline for deploying web applications to Elastic Beanstalk.

**Limitations**: Assumes familiarity with AWS services, CDK, and web application deployment. Requires appropriate IAM permissions and AWS CLI configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CDK installed.
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Docker installed and running (if your application requires Docker).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ECR_pipe
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Bootstrap the CDK environment**:

    ```sh
    cdk bootstrap
    ```

4. **Deploy the pipeline stack for ECR**:

    ```sh
    cd cicd_workshop/app-cdk
    cdk deploy
    ```

5. **Deploy the pipeline stack for Elastic Beanstalk**:

    ```sh
    cd ../../eb_cdk_pipe_tutorial/cdk-pipeline-eb-demo
    cdk deploy
    ```

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up CI/CD pipelines for different types of applications using AWS CDK. It covers Dockerized applications with ECR and web applications with Elastic Beanstalk, demonstrating the flexibility and power of AWS CDK in managing infrastructure as code
